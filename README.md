# Cheat Sheet

### A quick refrence to the Markdown syntax

## Over view

This markdown cheat sheet provides ovweview of all the Mark down syntax 
elements. It can't cover every edge case, so if you need more information about any of these 
elements, refer to our refrence guides for [basic syntax](http://www.basicsyntax.com) and [extended syntax](http://www.extendedsyntax).

## Basic Syntax

These are the elements outlined in John Gruber's original design document. 
All mark down applications support these elements.
